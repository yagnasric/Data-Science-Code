The analysis of this Dataset is done using Python libraries like: 1. Pandas 2.Matplotlib 3. Seaborn. The total number of data sets imported using pandas are four, namely: 
1. covid_19_clean_complete 2. country_wise_latest 3. usa_county_wise 4. worldometer_data. Firstly Null Values in each dataset is checked. Out of all the datasets only worldometer_data has significant Null Values
Rest all the datasets has no Null Values. The date column in df_clean dataset is converted to a convient date format for further exeuction for Machine Learning/Dataset wrangling purposes. 
A new dataset called global_ts is declared wherein the total sum of all the Confirmed, Deaths and Recovered is are arranged Date wise. A graph is then plotted using this global_ts which shows how
the total Confirmed, Deaths and Recovered are realted to Date. The graphs shown using this method indicates that there is a sharp increaase in the spread of the disease. Primarily the Confiremd and
Recovered cases are increasing at a faster pace than Death cases. 
A new dataset is introduced called 'latest' it rearranges the df_clean dataset by the latest dates in the top. Using this dataset another dataset is created called country_totals it contains all sum
of all the Confirmed, Deaths and Recovered arranged by each 'Cpuntry/Region'. Out of these top 15 Confirmed cases are stored in a new dataset called 'top15'. A barplot is made using Seaborn library
where x = 'Confiremd' cases, y = 'Country/Reagion' and its dataset = 'top15'. 
Next out of all the 'top15' countries 'top6' countries are taken with their Confirmed cases and as well as their Dates. Using Matplotlib library a graph is for top 6 countries where x-axis is 
Dates, y-axis = Confirmed cases. 
A dataset called daily_new is created where is represents each case Confirmed, Deaths and Recovered per given Date. Number of Confirmed cases per given data is then plotted as a barplot graph 
using Seaborn library. 
Next Death rate is calculatedd for each Country/Region by dividing country_totals['Deaths']/country_totals['Confirmed'] columns and naming it as country_totals['cfr'] for further data visualizatoin 
purposes. Out of all the Death rates the top 15 Countries Death Rates are plotted as a bar graph. 
From Seaborn library a Heatmap is also is plotted with Confirmed, Deaths and Recovered data. Most of these variables are highly correalated (which is expected). 
A 'RecoveryRate' column is added in df_country dataset whose definition is (RecoveredCases/ConfirmedCases)*100. Out of these top 10 recoveries are considered for further analysis. 
A barplot is illustrated wherein x = 'RecoveryRate', y = 'Country/Region'. 
In USA for each state total sum of cases is considered as a single dataset. Out of these top 10 are considered and a barplot is plotted with respect to confirmed cases and Country/Region.
By plaotting all the graphs and barplotts relevant insightss are drawn. Like which Country/Region has growth rate in terms of Confirmed/ Recovered Cases.
Also what are the vaious correaltion factors of Confiremd, Deaths and Recovered variabels for each Country/Region.
