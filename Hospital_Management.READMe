Four csv files have been imported using read_csv method in Pandas: 1. service_weekly 2. staff 3. patients 4. staff_schedule. Using Seborn Satisfaction levels are visualized woth respect 
to every services in patients.csv file by barplot method. Out of all the services General Medicine has least satisfaction and Surgery has highest satisfaction levels. A new column is added 
in the patients.csv file called 'age_group'. This is made using 'cut' method in pands to make list of age_groups like '0-10', '10-20', .. , '60+'. Next 'age_group' and 'satsifaction_levels' are
plotted as a barplot using seaborn. Among these there is not much variation among the different 'age_groups'. Arrival Month in terms of a number is extracted from 'Arrival _Date' column in 
patients.csv file. A barplot is plotted between 'Arrival_Month' and 'Satisfaction_Levels'. The data is pretty consistent except there is a slight dip in the March month.
